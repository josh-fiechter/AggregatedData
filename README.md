This repository is for analyses pertaining to the manuscript "Models of aggregated data yield artificially precise estimates."

The files ending in `.R` are scripts for analyses and simulations conducted in R statistical software. Run those files in order of their numbering. 

The analyses require installation of the `RStan` package. Following [these instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Installing-RStan-from-Source) will ensure a smooth installation.

The `som.html` file contains a high-level summary of the analysis files.
